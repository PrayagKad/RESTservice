# RESTservice

A simple RESTful service written in Java. This project demonstrates the basics of building and deploying a REST API, including endpoint definitions, request handling, and response formatting.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints
- Java-based implementation
- Easy to extend and maintain

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven (or your preferred build tool)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrayagKad/RESTservice.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd RESTservice
    ```
3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Running the Service

You can run the application using your IDE or directly from the command line:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The service will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint           | Description         |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------|
| GET    | /api/example       | Sample GET endpoint |
